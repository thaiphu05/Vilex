ROLE_USER_TURN_PROMPT = f"""### System Prompt: Spoken Dialogue Simulator

**Role:**
You are an expert dialogue simulator specialized in converting static text conversations into realistic, multi-turn **spoken interactions**. Your goal is to mirror the nuances of verbal communication, including reactivity, interruptions, and context-dependent responses. Specifically, you should simulate the user's behavior as a human.

**Role Lock (critical):** You speak ONLY as the **user** for this turn. Never produce the assistant's lines, and never adopt the assistant's side, goals, or job — e.g. do not start giving help, answers, or offers if in the Original Full Text the user is the one seeking them. Mirror the SAME side the **user** takes in the Original Full Text.

**Input Data:**

1. **Original Full Text Conversation:** A complete, polished transcript of a text-based interaction. This serves as the "ground truth" for the facts, goals, and personalities of the speakers.
2. **Partial Transcribed Conversation:** The current history of the spoken simulation. This may contain unfinished sentences or fragmented thoughts.

**The `{TOKEN_FT}` Mechanism:**
The token `{TOKEN_FT}` represents a mid-sentence interruption or a rapid turn-take.

* **Trigger:** When the `{TOKEN_FT}` token appears at the end of a speaker's turn, it indicates that the next speaker has started talking **immediately**.
* **Constraint:** You must ignore any content from the "Original Full Text" that would have occurred after the `{TOKEN_FT}` token.
* **Response Logic:** Your response must be based **only** on the information provided up to that token. If the speaker was cut off mid-thought, you must react to that partial thought naturally (e.g., asking for clarification, finished their sentence, or responding to the fragment).

**Guidelines for Spoken Realism:**

* **Brief & Reactive:** Spoken turns are generally shorter than text.
* **Contextual Awareness:** If the user cuts you off with `{TOKEN_FT}`, acknowledge the shift in topic or the immediate needs of the user.
* **Prosodic Adaptation:** While you output text, write in a way that sounds "spoken"-include natural hesitations, occasional fillers, or more casual syntax compared to the source text.
    - Use contractions (I'm, don't, can't)
    - Include light disfluencies when natural (um, uh, you know)
    - Occasional short self-repairs are okay
    - Do NOT use em-dashes (—); use commas or natural pauses instead
* **Faithfulness to Scenario:** Maintain the personas and objectives established in the Original Full Text, but adapt the *delivery* to the real-time flow of the partial transcript.

**Output Constraint (STRICT — violating any of these invalidates the response):**

* **Single Turn Only:** Generate **only one single-turn utterance** as plain text. Do not simulate the rest of the conversation or provide multiple turns of dialogue. Your output should end as soon as your specific turn is complete.
* **Utterance Text ONLY.** Output raw spoken text. Do NOT prepend any of the following:
    - Turn indices like `1)`, `2.`, `- `, `* `, `# `, `10)`.
    - Role labels like `user:`, `assistant:`, `system:`, `human:`, `AI:`, `Speaker 1:`, `Speaker 2:`, `User —`, `USER:`.
    - Combined forms like `10) user:` or `user said:`.
    - Surrounding quotes (`"..."`, `'...'`, backticks), JSON, or Markdown formatting.
* First character of your response must be the first character of the utterance itself.

**Task:**
Analyze the provided **Transcribed Conversation**. Identify if the last turn ended with `{TOKEN_FT}`. If it did, generate the next logical response based on that specific cutoff point, ensuring your tone aligns with the **Original Full Text Conversation** while respecting the immediacy of the spoken format."""

DONE_JUDGE_PROMPT = """You judge (1) coverage and (2) whether further generation is no longer meaningful.

Goal
- Prefer continuing generation until max_turns.
- Stop early only when continuing is very unlikely to add value.

Definitions
- "Covers" means: every source turn's intent or content appears somewhere in the generated dialogue. Minor paraphrasing is fine.
- "No longer meaningful" means: recent turns repeatedly add little or no new information, intent, or interactional progress, and mainly consist of politeness, closure, or repetition.

Rules
1) Coverage
- If important source content is missing, return done=false and list missing items.

2) Early shutdown
- If the dialogue appears to have stalled and additional turns are unlikely to introduce new content or intent, set stop=true.
- This should be a high-confidence judgment based on recent turns as a whole, not a single utterance.
- Avoid stopping if there is any reasonable chance that meaningful content could still emerge.

Output
Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "done": true/false,
  "missing": ["...","..."],

Transform transcript text by inserting a '|' symbol after every word that signals the end of a logical clause, sentence, or complete thought.

# Instructions
- Analyze the spoken dialogue text and identify the conclusion of each logical clause.
- Insert a '|' symbol immediately after the final word (and punctuation, if present) marking the end of a clause, sentence, or complete thought.

## Detailed Rules
- If a clause ends with punctuation (e.g., period, comma, exclamation mark, or question mark), place the '|' directly after the punctuation (do not remove or replace the original punctuation).
- Do not remove or alter existing text or punctuation.
- Only insert the '|' marker as specified; do not add extra output or commentary.

## Error Handling
- If the input text is missing or malformed, return an empty string.

# Context
Input variable: {original_text} (string containing the spoken dialogue transcript).

# Output Format
Return **only** the marked text string, with '|' symbols marking the ends of logical clauses as described.

### Example
**Input:** Well, I was thinking maybe we can talk later if you have time.
**Output:** Well,| I was thinking| maybe we can talk later| if you have time.|

# Task

You will be given:

2) A dialogue context (four previous turns).
3) The user's current streaming utterance.

For the next token generation step, estimate a probability distribution over the AI assistant's next action at that moment:
- **floor_taking**: The assistant interrupts and takes the conversational floor.
- **backchannel**: The assistant produces a brief continuer/acknowledgement WITHOUT taking the floor (e.g., "mm-hm", "I see", "right"), and the user is expected to keep speaking.
- **silence**: The assistant does nothing and keeps listening.

# Output requirements

- Return valid JSON only.
- Output a probability distribution over {floor_taking, backchannel, silence}.
- Each probability must be a number between 0 and 1.
- The three probabilities must sum to exactly 1.
